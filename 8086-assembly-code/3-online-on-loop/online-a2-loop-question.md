A _faulty_ number is one for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors except 1 and the number itself. For example, 12 is a _faulty_ number because the sum of its proper divisors is 2+3+4+6=15 which is greater than 12. Write a program to take an integer number N as input and output the number of _faulty_ numbers between 1 and N.
